# DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern

This repository is a simple project on DAO, which is a pattern used to separate
business layer from persistence layer in an application.

My implementation of the DAO pattern is coded in Vanilla Java, which is a CRUD module to manipulate two entities: `Seller` and `Department`.

_The implementation is based on a [Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) available at Udemy, by [Nelio Alves](https://github.com/acenelio)._
